**Spec: Smart Embedded Video Player with Unlockable Content**

---

## üîç Overview

A lightweight, iframe-embeddable video player that supports both public and protected (gated) videos. If a video is protected, the player must check if the user has access and present unlock options if not. Authentication and unlock logic are offloaded to popup/redirect flows on the main site, and access is enforced via the presence or absence of a `signedUrl`.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Summary

- **Embedded via iframe** into third-party sites.
- **Fetches metadata** for the video on load.
- Uses **signed URLs** to determine access.
- Unlock/purchase/authenticate flows are handled **externally** (popup/redirect to main site).
- Communicates with external window via `window.open` or `postMessage`.

## üåê API Endpoints

### `GET /api/videos/:id/metadata`

Returns metadata:

```ts
{
  id: string;
  title: string;
  isPublic: boolean;
  previewUrl?: string;
  thumbnailUrl?: string;
  unlockOptions: UnlockOption[];
}
```

### `GET /api/videos/:id/signed-url`

Returns access status:

```ts
{
  signedUrl: string | null;
  access: boolean;
  reason?: "not_logged_in" | "not_unlocked" | "error";
}
```

### `POST /api/videos/:id/unlock`

(External flow handles this)

## üìπ UI Placement & Behavior

- Auth and unlock flows happen in popup or redirect.
- Player listens for `postMessage` or reloads on return.
- Top-right corner can show auth indicator (e.g., user email, avatar, wallet address)
